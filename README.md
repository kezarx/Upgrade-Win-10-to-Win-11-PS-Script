How to run this script: 

First download the ISO from windows 
  extract the ISO so you can have the setup.exe 
  (TIP) if you are doing this for more than one PC its best to create a share drive on the server and share out the setup.exe also make sure the permission for that share drive is set to allow for everyone 
EX: 
\\server\win11\setup.exe 

Once you have the share drive you can configure the script and remove the "D:\setup.exe" to your "\\server\setup.exe\" 

to troubleshoot the script remove the "/quite" and run it again on PC
